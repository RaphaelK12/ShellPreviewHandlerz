# Deprecation information

While checking some of the links in this document, I eventually stumbled upon another [MarkdownPreview](https://github.com/Atrejoe/MarkdownPreview). Check it out, I did not maintain this one for ages - therefore,
rather consider this deprecated.

# Preview Handlerz

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ofbwfnrw4n0gd4nq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xasx/shellpreviewhandlerz)


Here you find some code for preview handlers (one) that are most commonly missed in
Windows.

## Current status

Includes
* Markdown Preview Handler, using [CommonMark.NET]

## Development (blabla currently only)

By using C#, [SharpShell] and other popular libraries, this project should be based
on a solid foundation.

Contribute using usual GitHub fork-pr-model or issues.

## Using

Find documentation on how to install on the SharpShell GitHub pages, in particular
installation via [srm].

More to come in time, especially installers etc.
